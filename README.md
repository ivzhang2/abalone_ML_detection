# abalone_ML_detection
Calculate age/rings of abalone based on a series of factors

- Uses an abalone dataset with their 'Length', 'Diameter', 'Height', 'Whole_weight', 'Shucked_weight', 'Viscera_weight', 'Shell_weight', and 'Rings' to predict the age/rings of an abalone. 

- Assumes that abalones grow at a rate of 1 ring/1 year

It was interesting because I like to eat abalones and detecting how old each one is, is pretty cool.
